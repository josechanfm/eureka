"dashboard_intro":"The university scientific research project budget management system mainly includes four major categories of projects: on-campus projects are scientific research activities supported by internal funds of the university and are designed to promote academic research and innovation on campus. They usually have flexible budget management and faster fund allocation processes; Macau Science and Technology Development Fund projects are funded through funds from the Macau SAR government and aim to promote local technological innovation. The application process is more formal and requires the submission of detailed plans and budgets; off-campus commissioned projects are commissioned by external organizations such as enterprises or government departments. The research emphasizes cooperation with industry and has clear contract management and results delivery requirements; in addition, other projects cover scientific research projects that do not meet the above categories, which may involve self-funding or special funding, and can flexibly respond to different research needs. And corresponding budget management strategies need to be formulated according to specific circumstances.",
